## About Me


<details>
    ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark. If you're reading this, I'm looking forward to working together! Consider this my user manual on how to work with me as a co-worker and as a direct report. A little bit about me first, I grew up outside of NYC in NJ but have spent time living in CT, the Bay Area, and now back east on Long Island with my wife and three kids. Fun fact, my full name is Justin Mark Ryan III but I've always gone by my middle name. I try my best to get all of my accounts to reflect that, but you may see some artifacts of my full name leftover (like my email).

## How to Contact Me


<details><br>
    I'm generally avaialble 9am-7pm ET, M-F. Outside of those hours, I will do my best to respond to messages. If it's urgent, a phone call/message is   best.<br><br>
    Slack is my preferred method of communication for quick messages or to get my attention for impromtu converstations if we're not in the office together. We can also start a slack thread and move to a call if a longer conversation is warranted. I'll always acknowlege your message with at least an emoji to show you I've read it.<br><br>
    Email is a necessary evil for me, but I will do my best to respond quickly. If I haven't replied to somthing that needs my attention, please send me a reminder in Slack/phone/messages.<br><br> 
    I keep my calendar up to date, so if there's a time available, feel free to book it. My only ask is to put a note about the topic so I can be well prepared for our meeting.<br><br>

## Feedback


<details><br>
    I like to receive feedback frequently to make sure I'm on track or to make adjustments as I go (I'd rather make a small adjustment early rather than be surprised duiring a review session).<br><br>
    I prefer my feedback in-person (or on Webex). Our 1:1s are a good time to give me quick bits of feedback.
</details>

## Preferred Working Style


<details><br>
    I typically prefer quiet work with few disruptions. I structure my day to do focused work in the moring and early afternoon.<br><br>
    Multi-tasking is not productive for me (or anyone!) so I will focus on one task at a time, usually the one with the closest due date. Please let me know the priority when giving me a task so I can fit it into my workstream approprately.
</details>

## What Motivates Me


<details><br>
    I'm interested in both the business case and the techincal details of the work we do. I enjoy a technical challenge that can be worked through as a team to provide tangible outcomes for the product. I really like to see the impact of the projects I work on.<br><br>
    I enjoy working with data. Digging into details and finding the story within the data is particulary motivating. I'm also energized by building visual aids to help convey the story.

    <summary>Tips</summary>
Optional Section: There are some sections that are deliberately omitted from this template, but which arguably should be here - depending on your role, how comfortable you are sharing with your team etc. You may want to include these or use them as inspiration for your own.

- "How I like myÂ 1:1s" - This might be more relevant for managers to set expectations of their direct reports. Although direct reports certainly should have a say in how their 1:1s are structured
- "Quirks" - While this is a fun one, there is a temptation to hide behaviour here that probably should be worked on instead. Additionally, behaviour is complex, situation dependent and evolving. Stating you have a particular quirk makes it immutable and sets the expectation that you will always act like this. That said please feel free to include a section like this as it's a good icebreaker, and adds a personal touch. Just be aware that you might be unaware of some of your own "quirky" behaviour.
- "How to interpret my calendar" - If you're someone with wall to wall meetings every day it might be difficult for colleagues to find a good time to speak with you. If this is the case, then this section might be helpful to outline when you typically could make time for them.
- "What you can expect from me" - Another one that might be useful for line managers, career coaches and mentors more than ICs. You may want to use this to set expectations around how often you'll be scheduling catchups, how you share feedback and what sort of support you can offer.
