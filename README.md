## About Me


<details>
    ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark. If you're reading this, I'm looking forward to working together! Consider this my user manual on how to work with me as a co-worker and as a direct report. A little bit about me first, I grew up outside of NYC in NJ but have spent time living in CT, the Bay Area, and now back east on Long Island with my wife and three kids. Fun fact, my full name is Justin Mark Ryan III but I've always gone by my middle name. I try my best to get all of my accounts to reflect that, but you may see some artifacts of my full name leftover (like my email).

## How to Contact Me


<details><br>
    I'm generally avaialble 9am-7pm ET, M-F. Outside of those hours, I will do my best to respond to messages. If it's urgent, a phone call/message is   best.<br><br>
    Slack is my preferred method of communication for quick messages or to get my attention for impromtu converstations if we're not in the office together. We can also start a slack thread and move to a call if a longer conversation is warranted. I'll always acknowlege your message with at least an emoji to show you I've read it.<br><br>
    Email is a necessary evil for me, but I check it freqently and tend to write replys in the evening. If I haven't replied to somthing that needs my attention, please send me a reminder in Slack/phone/messages.<br><br> 
    I keep my calendar up to date, so if there's a time available, feel free to book it. My only ask is to put a note about the topic so I can be well prepared for our meeting.<br><br>

## Feedback


<details><br>
    I like to receive feedback frequently to make sure I'm on track or to make adjustments as I go (I'd rather make a small adjustment early rather than be surprised duiring a review session).<br><br>
    I prefer my feedback in-person (or on Webex). Our 1:1s are a good time to give me quick bits of feedback.

## Preferred Working Style


<details><br>
    I typically prefer quiet work with few disruptions when focusing on individual tasks. I structure my day to do focused work in the moring and early afternoon. When collaborating, I prefer to have working sessions where the work is done synchronosly and ideas can be free flowing.<br><br>
    Multi-tasking is not productive for me (or anyone!) so I will focus on one task at a time, usually the one with the closest due date. Please let me know the priority when giving me a task so I can fit it into my workstream approprately.

## What Motivates Me


<details><br>
    I'm interested in both the business case and the techincal details of the work we do. I enjoy a technical challenge that can be worked through as a team to provide tangible outcomes for the product. I really like to see the impact of the projects I work on.<br><br>
    I enjoy working with data. Digging into details and finding the story within the data is particulary motivating. I'm also energized by building visual aids to help convey the story.

## What Demotivates Me


<details><br>
    If I don't understand the wider purpose behind why we are doing something, I find it hard to engage with.<br><br>
    I find it hard to focus if I've been on video calls all day. If I turn off my video in a group meeting, I'm still listening but I need a break from the camera.
